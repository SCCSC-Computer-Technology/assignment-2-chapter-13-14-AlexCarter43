Nice program and design. I liked your use of getting rid of excess decimals by manipulating the string. Making a clear method and is smart as well as and nice implementation. I was unable to get your program to crash as I was testing and you have nice data validation in place with your TryParses. 

Your naming convention is nice and I understand what I am looking at when I read your code and do not have to jump back and forth. The only thing you could change I would say is that you do not need to make result1, result2 and so on you could have just named them all results and still would not have encountered an error. Other than that this is solid code.
