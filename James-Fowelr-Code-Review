Application is user-friendly and handles errors well
I like that diffrent colors were used for the buttons to make it easy to read
The code is very organized and your comments are very well thoughtout
The user experience as far as searching for products is done very well and a child could use it
You have a solid foundation that shows understable code and a nice to look at UI.
